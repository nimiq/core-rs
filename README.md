# Nimiq Core implementation in Rust _(core-rs)_

![nimiq](docs/nimiq_logo_rgb_horizontal.png)

> Rust implementation of the Nimiq Blockchain Core

**[Nimiq](https://nimiq.com/)**  is a frictionless payment protocol for the web.

This repository is archived. You can use the [JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/nimiq/core-js/) instead.
Or if you are looking for the [Albatross Rust implementation](https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs-albatross/), check the corresponding repository.

The Nimiq Rust client comes without wallet and can currently not be used to send transactions. As a back-bone node it is more performant than the JavaScript implementation though.

## Background

- [Nimiq White Paper](https://www.nimiq.com/whitepaper/): General information about the Nimiq project.
- [Nimiq Developer Reference](https://nimiq-network.github.io/developer-reference/): Details of the protocol architecture.


## Install

Around 2GB of RAM is needed to compile. Besides [Rust nightly](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started#installing-rust) itself, the following packages are required to be able to compile this source code:

- `gcc`
- `pkg-config`
- `libssl-dev` (in Debian/Ubuntu) or `openssl-devel` (in Fedora/Red Hat)

### From crates.io

To download from [crates.io](https://crates.io), compile and install the client:

```bash
cargo +nightly install nimiq-client
```

The binary will be installed in your Cargo directory, which is usually at `$HOME/.cargo/bin`, and should be available in your `$PATH`.

### From Git

Compiling the project is achieved through [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs
cd core-rs
cargo +nightly build
```

Note that this will build it in debug mode, which is not as performant. To get the most speed out of the client, build it in release mode:

```bash
cargo +nightly build --release
```

If you want to install the client onto your system (into `$HOME/.cargo/bin`), run:

```bash
cargo +nightly install --path client/
```

Alternatively you can install directly from git:

```bash
cargo +nightly install --git https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs.git
```


After installing the client you can use it as if you had downloaded it from [crates.io](https://crates.io).

## Usage

After installation, you can run the client directly, like this:

```bash
nimiq-client
```

### Configuration

By default the client will look for a configuration file in `$HOME/.nimiq/client.config`. You need to create this file yourself:

```bash
nimiq-client                                                   # Run the client. This will create the example config file.
cp $HOME/.nimiq/client.example.toml $HOME/.nimiq/client.toml   # Create your config from the example.
nano $HOME/.nimiq/client.toml                                  # Edit the config. Explanations are included in the file.
```

You can also specify your own configuration file:

```bash
nimiq-client -c path/to/client.toml
```

Take a look at [`client/client.example.toml`](client/client.example.toml) for all the configuration options.
